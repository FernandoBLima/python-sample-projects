# Samples of python applications

The purpose of this repository is to show samples of microservices using Python that I am searching and learning.

The following projects were created using Docker:
- [Python microservices using AIOHTTP](https://github.com/FernandoBLima/python-sample-projects/tree/main/0.1_PYTHON_DOCKER)
- [Python and RabbitMQ microservices](https://github.com/FernandoBLima/python-sample-projects/tree/main/0.2_PYTHON_RABBITMQ_DOCKER)
- [Python and MongoDB microservice](https://github.com/FernandoBLima/python-sample-projects/tree/main/0.3_PYTHON_MONGODB_DOCKER)
